Changelog for Centipede!

// Known Issues
-	Server does not reset everything when it returns to lobby
	after the game round ends
-	Client needs to reset everything too (except connection
	and users on server)
-	No collision with surrounding of the world (needs to have
	simplified collision geometry added to the model rather
	than collisions with visible geometry)
-	Need to add centipede-centipede collisions
-	No real end game condition (last man standing? length of
	centipede? time limit?)

Lots of files
-	Refactored some parts to conform to coding style (need to
	write document sometime...)
-	Removed some rubbish files
	
centipede.py
-	Added destroy function for resetting of game state between
	rounds

food.py

game.py
-	Got rid of util file and added the setValue function to here
-	Added destroy function to call centipede/food/world destroys

login_server_core.py
-	Refactored into loginserver.py

login_server_inst.py
-	Refactored into loginserver.py

loginserver.py
-	Refactored login_server_core and login_server_inst into one
	file

main.py
-	Changed game flow a little bit to allow for round end to
	return to game lobby, and for disconnect to go back to
	main menu
-	Now initialization of MainMenu and Pregame are done after
	login, and hide and show functions are used instead of
	destroying and creating when needed

mainmenu.py
-	Added show method for when disconnect brings client back to
	main menu

pregame.py
-	Removed dependency on librocket, now uses directGUI only
-	Still need to implement showing chat log and players/ready
-	Toggle Ready/Disconnect and message sending works

preround.py
-	Removed as not needed in centipede game

round.py
-	Added destroy method for when round ends

server.py
-	Fixed bug where updating clients would try to send data to
	disconnected clients (now checks for connection)
-	Refactored code a bit, now calls prepareGame function when
	all clients are ready which prepares the game state and
	broadcasts required data before starting game loop

util.py
-	Refactored and removed and put the functions into the
	files required

world.py
-	Added destroy function

camerahandler.py
-	Modified to suit Centipede game (stolen from Warlocks :P)

centipede.py
-	Added spawn positions, they spawn in a circle around the
	center, based on the number of players.
-	Split the update function into rotation and movement
-	Fixed the movement to use headsUp function now, much
	smoother.
-	Fixed tail heading to be the same as the head (for all but
	centipede number 0)

game.py
-	Setup GameData (at the moment just seed and max foods)
-	Made GameHandler a DirectObject so it can accept the
	controls, rather than accepting using the 'showbase'
-	Setup Game to initialize the seed (sent from server)
-	Made Game also a DirectObject to handle the collision
	events (need to add ignore on destroy)
-	Collision Handler is setup for centipede heads to foods
-	Still need to setup centipede heads to other centipedes
	and also with the surrounding of the world
-	Added temporary game over condition (when a centipede gets
	more than 10 body parts)
-	Removed useless print or collisions

user.py
-	Changed to centipede instead of warlock

main.py
-	Added an end round function for when game round ends so
	client returns to pre game lobby

pregame.py
-	Added a show function for when end round function is called
	to show lobby again

round.py
-	Added hide function (just removes game loop from the taskMgr

server.py
-	Added return to lobby part when game ends
