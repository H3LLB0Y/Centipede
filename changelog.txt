Changelog for Centipede!

//------------------------------------------------------------//
Version:	0.0.1
Author:		H3LLB0Y
Date:		03/12/2012

// Known Issues
-	Server does not reset everything when it returns to lobby
	after the game round ends
-	Client needs to reset everything too (except connection
	and users on server)
-	No collision with surrounding of the world (needs to have
	simplified collision geometry added to the model rather
	than collisions with visible geometry)
-	Need to add centipede-centipede collisions
-	No real end game condition (last man standing? length of
	centipede? time limit?)

// File Changes
camerahandler.py
-	Modified to suit Centipede game (stolen from Warlocks :P)

centipede.py
-	Added spawn positions, they spawn in a circle around the
	center, based on the number of players.
-	Split the update function into rotation and movement
-	Fixed the movement to use headsUp function now, much
	smoother.
-	Fixed tail heading to be the same as the head (for all but
	centipede number 0)

game.py
-	Setup GameData (at the moment just seed and max foods)
-	Made GameHandler a DirectObject so it can accept the
	controls, rather than accepting using the 'showbase'
-	Setup Game to initialize the seed (sent from server)
-	Made Game also a DirectObject to handle the collision
	events (need to add ignore on destroy)
-	Collision Handler is setup for centipede heads to foods
-	Still need to setup centipede heads to other centipedes
	and also with the surrounding of the world
-	Added temporary game over condition (when a centipede gets
	more than 10 body parts)
-	Removed useless print or collisions

user.py
-	Changed to centipede instead of warlock

main.py
-	Added an end round function for when game round ends so
	client returns to pre game lobby

pregame.py
-	Added a show function for when end round function is called
	to show lobby again

round.py
-	Added hide function (just removes game loop from the taskMgr

server.py
-	Added return to lobby part when game ends
